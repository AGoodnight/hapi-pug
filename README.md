# Hapi Pug

<p>
A very simple boilerplate for server-side rendering <b>pug.js</b>
<br/>Also npm scripts to upload to s3 ( once you set that up ).
</p>
<p>
Run the local server with ```npm start```
</p>
Once running, you'll see a picture of a camera which on click will swap with another picture. Demonstrating on click events. The associated <b>javascript/jquery</b> for the pug templates are in the app directory.
